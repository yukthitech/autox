	<h3>Variables</h3>
	
	<p>
		In cases, where a complex expressions has to be used repeatedly or to minimize complexity of an expression, single expression 
		may needs to be divided, a dynamic variable will come handy. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Using <span class="blue-highlight">@Set</span> new variables can be declared which in turn can be accessed directly as standard context attributes.
	</p>

	<div class="example-box">
		<div class="example-heading">
			Example
		</div>
		<div class="example-body">
		{
		    "<span class="simple-blue">@set</span>(prodMap)": {
		          "productNames": "@xpathMulti: /products//name"
		    },
		
		   "key2": "@fmarker: prodMap.productNames[0]"
		
		}
		</div>
		<div class="example-desc">
			<p>
				In the above example, a variable “prodMap” is created with value as a map (defined on right side). 
				And then this variable is used in next line as a normal context attribute.
