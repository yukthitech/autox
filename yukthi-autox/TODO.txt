-----
else-if, else as separate steps

Proj tree node optimization
	when nodes are added or inserted right events has to be fired.
	
search within console

deep equals should give all differences in log
	path should be constructed for error path (id, name, key)
		extra keys should be accepted as attr



==================================================
Data provider change - jsonContext in clone and other places support "json:" prefix. Better to support all standard prefixes

classpath should come from maven not from lib folder

Though mssg "As this is interactive environment, skipping the report generation" comes in console (TestSuiteExecutor.java # 788)
	interactive in-progress dialog is not going off


For all steps where enum field is involved, the doc should include possible values (Eg: log level)

find or filter in console

if-else should be separate and sequential steps

console content should get auto cleaned once threshold is reached


06/04/21
-=========
Delete project
	not removing from state file. So it reopens in next start
	index is not getting corrected, becos of which files are accessible from old location
	
Open Project
	should update state file and index immediately
	

06-8
====

Extra closing bracket is not showing error:
	<f:addJwt env="stage" statusCode="200">>
	
Sometimes in interactive env console logs are not coming


19/11
-====
	Warnings to be shown in ide
		when "." is used in "attr:" expression indicate it might be mistake
		when ${} expressions are used within freemarker context
		
		>, <, &gt; &lt; should not be used in <s:if> step as it will result in problems
			in s:if itself we can replace, that is one way

06/11
	Data-setup and cleanup logs are added as part of first and last steps resp.
	Instead it should be handled separately. 

11/10
	STATS
	=====
		Steps to 
			store stats data (date wise)
			generate graph image - store generated path to context
			send mail (with fmarker template) with support of embedding images
			
	SEARCH
	=====
		ability to search multiple files in proj explorer

	DEBUG
	=======
		In interactive environment 
			we should be able to set debug points
			on F8 control should go to next debug point
			on F5 control should get into method if any
			F6 execute current step and move to next step
			
		Ability to start debug from scratch with above features
			on change of current file and saving, current file should load and should take affect
				if needed drop to start of function / test case
				
	RUN
	===
		Recently executions should come under run drop down
		Run configuration dialog
			to customize command line args
			jvm args
			class path etc
			
		upto date running report should be generated
		
	Ability to do performance related testing
	
	In progress dialog is not that good looking
	

26/07
	fix search in reports
	
	Externalize a value to app properties
		should have ability to find this value in all test cases externalize it


19/07/2019

Making <set> specific to function/test cases (stack wise)
Multi threaded execution.
On going report generation
	should append data to text or some struct file
	Html should be able to read from this file
	should reload the file every few secs... till the status is completed or errored
May have to display the log page wise
Fix the filter problem in log files

In  IDE
	JX path play area (ability to evaluate jx path on input json, add, get and remove)
		with docs (from online? )
	Recently executed menu
		

Click step - 
	Wait time should be configurable
	
All ui files should 


==================================
step to execute substeps in parallel
	step to simply group the steps. So that multiple groups can be executed in parallel
	
To store analytics data in a execution or across the execution
	generate graphs using this analytics data
	
Ability to include graphs within summary mails and reports

======================
Collection/map steps
	create new collection/map
	add/put an entry
	remove an entry
	filter entries
		filter based on free marker expression
		result as different attr or same (defaults to same)
	find an entry (similar to filter but results in single entry)
	compare 2 collections for equality
	contains all functionality

Remove raw resource types and ccg:skipExpressions for skipping expression parsing
	this should set flag on context which should be referrd in automation utils
	
In SetStep and others wherever object is expected we should be able to inject value using ccg:attrRef

===================
	Default data source should be possible
	
	

	Ability to specify load order

	Step to comparare collections (ordered and unordered)

	
	rest steps to use different base urls
	
	Test cases for ui steps/validators
	
	customizations doc
	
	Step group doc

	screen shot on error
	
	
	
	Step to fail test case
	
	not equals validation

	renmote log
		fetch only on error
		enabled/disabled
		
	logger should be enabled on demand, or may want to enabled only on error

Exection plan
	executing dependency test cases

In final report skip test suites which are not executed

artifacts/Doc upload to yukthitech.com

========================
Doc
============
Examples for each
other documents

command line arguments doc
resource and references
data beans and load time references

expected exception doc

step groups and references

==============

Extra params in final report
	like build, environment, date, custom params
	
	
time taken by test cases and steps

Line number in xml based errors

================================================
Reports
	Simple overview report without external dependencies
		as pdf??
		logo??
	
==========================



why first driver is not being used?

=======================================

Test Cases
	Expected Exception
		Successful
		never occurred
		mismatched
	
	Basic
		step results in error
		validation result in error
		validation failed
		
	Data provider
		provides empty list
		one object results in error
		one object results in failure
		
		
	test cases to validate cmd args

	file upload and download
		resources
		
	test case to ensure skip and failure
========================================
