ctrl + click for attributes and custom prefixes
	
Graph support
	Basic
		pass % over overall - pie chart (include success, failue, error rates)
		tracked param % - code coverage % pie chart
	Ierative
		pass % over executions - XY graph
		tracked param % over executions - code coverage % pie chart
	
using advanced selenium

post man like ui for code generation
mongo query box with code generation

startup params
	execute test suites in mutli threaded mode

ide automaed testing 
========================
Function execution
Parsing xml optimization
	instead of using rsyntax syntax parsing, custom parser should be used
		so that only changed text will be parsed all the time
	based on current token auto-complete or current context should be determind (current full parsing is process intensive)
	
	auto completion for custom prefixes
	auto completion for prefix expr attributes with doc
	
	custom expressions should be CTRL + clickable
	
Changing one file may resulting fixing or generating error in other file
	needs means update this in ide dynamically
	
attr name hyperlinking
report cdn urls
	dynamic or in-progress report viewing
class path based on maven
Renaming a function
extracting static value into app prop
maven class path
Console panel
	filter - filter lines with given text (option to display specified pre and post match lines also)
Wrap and font-size-change are throwing exception by RsyntaxTextarea sometimes

Tab short cuts
	prev tab, next tab, close tab
	
Perf test case support
	with graphs
	
Graphs for generic params (in summary mail also)
	test cases pass trend
	code coverage trend
	
error/warning evaluation should be externalized and should be done based on generic framework of rules
	param-type
	full-expr-error/warning
	partial error/warning (patterns/regions to highlight)
	Same with auto completion
