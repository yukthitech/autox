		During testing of rest apis, json payloads will be required as part of input payloads and output payloads. And these needs to be dynamic for different
		use cases. One way to make them dynamic is using templating language like free-marker, but the json may not be valid json anymore especially when 
		if conditions or loops or complex data is involved.

	<h3>Json Expression Language</h3>
	<p>
		In such use cases, Json Expression Language (JEL) comes for rescue. JEL expressions gets embedded into json in json format itself (keeping the json 
		templates as valid json). It follows same processing steps as that of free-marker templates as shown in below diagram.
